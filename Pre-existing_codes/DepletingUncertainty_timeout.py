Same as EasyPySpinFast_ExploreExploit_07 with corrections : now you can use the depleting function in a uncertainty context (with timeout for example)

Objective: have only one code for every reward/tower/direction (etc...)Ã  mode

2024.04.10 : Timeout for easy level
2024.05.18 : Dictionnary for open_times and GPIO are now imported
2024.09.05 : Change in the reward_function to obtain True or False

############################################################################################# As an experimenter, you are supposed to modify this part of the code only

EXPERIMENTER_NAME='Maud' #this is important to save your data properly
MOUSE_NAME='Tests' #this is important to save your data properly
CNO_INJECTION='none' #can be 'none' when there is no injection or can be the injection time (hour/minutes)


SESSION_DURATION = 60*1 #change the multiplier according to the number of minutes you want in your session (SESSION_DURATION is in seconds)
TIMEOUT = 0 #Starts when the animal leaves an object it was exploiting in 'decrease_turn' mode. Period in which no reward is delivered

##Directions parameters that can allow reward delivery:

POTENTIAL_DIRECTIONS=[270] #Here choose your one direction of interest
POTENTIAL_DIRECTIONS=[90,270] #Uncomment this line if you want both directions
#[90] = counterclockwise & [270] = clockwise ; ACCORDING TO THE VIEW FROM THE CAMERA BELOW

#currentDirectionMode = #Maybe this variable can be nice to say if the animal starts with a specific direction, then it has to stay with the same for the rest of the object exploitation
#Or if both directions are available, then it can change while exploiting and it will still give rewards

DIRECTION_MODE = 'free' #Can be 'switch', 'random' or 'free'
#switch: for example, if the current direction is CW, the next one will be CCW.
#random: the next direction is chosen randomly, means the current direction can be choosen again
#free: if both directions are selected, the rewardingDirection is the one the animal enters the object in. It cannot change direction while exploiting the same object, but this direction changes everytime it enters a new patch


##Rewards decrease mode and parameters:

REWARD_MODE = 'decrease_turns' #For now, can be 'decrease_turns' or 'fixed'
#If you put 'fixed', your max number of rewards is fixed. It can be a range, or just a single value but it means that once the animal has reached this max, no rewards are available at this spot
#If you put 'decrease_turns', it means that the number of rewards will decrease every time the mouse do a quarter turn.

#Parameters for the 'fixed' mode :
RANGE_REWARDS=[4,13] #Select the range of fixed rewards you want. If you put the decrease mode, no matter what those number are but it just need to be > 0

#Parameters for the 'decrease_turns' mode :
DEPLETING_SLOPE = 0.2
PLATEAU = 100 #When you reach this value, the probability (or number of turns) does not decrease anymore
DELAY = 2 #Number of rewarding quarter turns to do before it starts decreasing


##Parameters of rewarding objects:

POTENTIAL_OBJECTS=['NE','SW','SE','NW'] #Select the object(s) that can deliver rewards. Can be 1 to 4, any combinaison you want.

NB_ALTERNATIVE_OBJECTS=3 #Can be 1 to 4. Once the animal has collected all the rewards around an object, how many objects can potentially deliver rewards
OBJECT_MODE = 'switch' #Can be 'switch' or 'random'
#Is the switch mode really relevant for OBJECT_MODE ? Couldn't it be better with a 'free' mode in which animals can go wherever they want ?
#random: the next direction and object is chosen randomly, mean the current object or direction can be choosen again
TRAPEZE_SIZE = 30 #Normally you shouldn't have to change this value, except if you want to adapt the size of a trapeze for a specific analysis


##Allow (or not) variables

ALLOW_EARLY_EXPLO=True  #When True, if mice leave a patch before maxConsecutiveReward or PLATEAU is reached, a new rewarded patch is computed according to task rule
                            #when False, if mice leave a patch before maxConsecutivereward, they must come back to finish it (even if it tried to exploit in the wrong direction)
ALLOW_REWARD_DELIVERY=True  #if false, the solenoid valve will never be activated (usefull for exploration without reward or familiarization)


##Handling solenoid valves

TEST_VALVES = False #If you want to do tests with valves, and you want to know which one has been opened, set this to true

#The GPIO corresponds to the pin into which the valve is connected (in the raspberry pie)
